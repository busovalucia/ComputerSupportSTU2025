## Introduction

For performing practical tasks **R** and **R Studio** have to be installed.

Links for downloading programs: 

1. R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>

2. R Studio: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

3. Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/> 

The results of laboratory work must be placed in your repository on Github in the files `TaskX.qmd` (or `LabX.Rmd` if you prefer to use R markdown) and generated from it `TaskX.html`, where X is the number of the laboratory in the form: **question**, **code**, **result** (if necessary). So, the file structure could looks like:

```
--ComputerSupportSTU
  |--Task1.qmd
  |--Task1.html
  |--Task2.qmd
  |--Task2.html
```
Use a template for `qmd` document (file `template.qmd`) to generate correct html file

Example of output:

1.  Print rownames of dataset `mtcars`.

```{r}
row.names(mtcars)
```

## Task 0

1.  Create Github account
2.  Create new repository "ComputerSupportSTU"
3.  In readme.md file add title a short repository description

## Task 1: Exploring Data Types in R

You will create a small “universe” of data in R, using all major data types.

Your goal is to combine **creativity**, **logical thinking**, and **coding precision**.

You may choose **any theme** — a **fictional character**, **city**, **planet**, **company**, **ecosystem**, or even **your pet**. Everything you create in R should belong to this “mini universe.”

### 1. Atomic Types

Create the following variables related to your chosen object:

- **4 numeric** values (e.g., population, temperature, size, rating)  
- **3 integer** values (e.g., number of moons, buildings, inhabitants)  
- **2 logical** values (e.g., `has_water`, `is_inhabited`)  
- **3 character** values (e.g., `name`, `region`, `category`)

**Tip:** Think of these variables as *attributes* of your object.  
Use `print()` or `cat()` to describe them in one sentence.

### 2. Vectors

Create three different vectors:

1. **Numeric vector** combining all your numeric and integer variables.  
   *(Use `c()`.)*

2. **Sequence vector** from any number between 10–50 to 100, Choose step between 2 and 10.  
   *(Use `seq()` or `:`.)*

3. **Logical vector** of length 10 with random `TRUE`/`FALSE` values using `sample()`.

### 3. Matrix

Create a **3×3 matrix** with random numbers between **-50 and 50**  
(using `sample()` or `runif()`), and name its **rows and columns** according to your theme.

Then calculate row and column averages using `rowMeans()` and `colMeans()`.

### 4. List

Create a **list** that combines all your previous objects:  
atomic variables, vectors, and matrix.
Add one extra element — a short **description** of your universe as a string.

### 5. Factor

Create a **factor variable** representing categories within your universe, e.g.:

- `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`  
- `"infant"`, `"child"`, `"adult"`  
- `"poor"`, `"average"`, `"rich"`

Make sure you have **at least 5 observations** total.  
Then use `table()` to show how many objects fall into each category.

### 6. Data Frame

Create a **data frame** related to your object that includes:

1. **5–8 observations** (rows)  
2. **At least 3 columns** of different data types  
   (e.g., name, numeric value, logical flag, category)

Then:

- Rename the columns using `names()` or `colnames()`.  
- Display its structure with `str()` and its summary with `summary()`.  
- Add a new column derived from the others (for example, a ratio or condition).
